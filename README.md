Portfolio Landing Page

This is a Landing Page developed for personal use. Since Iâ€™m a Linux enthusiast, I decided to adopt a terminal-style interface to showcase my portfolio in a minimalist and dynamic way.

The project uses an array of words that are displayed with a typewriter effect inside a fake terminal window, giving the page an interactive and retro touch.
